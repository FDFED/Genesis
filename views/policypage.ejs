      <h2>       DISCLAIMER FOR CUSTOMERS
      </h2>
    
      The payable total amount, duration, and premium of a health insurance policy can vary widely depending on several factors, such as your age, health history, location, and the specific plan you choose.
        You should carefully review the details of each plan you are considering to understand the costs and benefits, as well as any restrictions or limitations. Typically, premiums are paid monthly or annually, and the duration of the policy can range from one year to several years, depending on the plan. The payable total amount will also depend on the specific plan and the amount of coverage provided.</p>

    <h2>        FACTORS DETERMINING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM CALCULATION
    </h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
<br><br>	<strong>Age:</strong> Generally, older individuals tend to have higher health insurance premiums than younger individuals because they are more likely to have health issues that require medical attention.
<br><br>	<strong>Gender:</strong> Women may have higher health insurance premiums than men because they tend to use medical services more frequently, especially during their reproductive years.
<br><br>    <strong>Medical history:</strong> If an individual has a pre-existing medical condition or has a history of serious health issues, they may have higher health insurance premiums.
<br><br>	<strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Health insurance companies may consider an individual's lifestyle factors, such as whether they smoke or drink alcohol, when determining their premiums. Individuals who engage in high-risk behaviors may have higher premiums.
<br><br>	<strong>Geographic location:</strong> The cost of healthcare can vary depending on the region or state, and health insurance premiums may reflect this.
<br><br>	<strong>Type of plan:</strong> Different types of health insurance plans, such as HMOs, PPOs, and high-deductible plans, have different premium costs.
<br><br>	<strong>Deductibles and copayments:</strong> Plans with higher deductibles and copayments typically have lower premiums, while plans with lower deductibles and copayments tend to have higher premiums.
